# rs-a 
An implementation of RSA, as specified in [RFC 8017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017), using Rust.

## Intended Usage
The goal of this project is to implement a basic RSA library that includes encryption, decryption, key generation, signature, and verification functions. 

This isn't intended to be a production-grade library; this is more of an exercise in writing Rust code, learning about RSA, and trying to write code that adheres to a written standard. 

While the library contained herein is intended to adhere to [RFC 8017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017), the end-product is not designed to be used for commercial purposes. For more specific language as to the purposes of this repository, consult the [license](LICENSE).
